NOTES FOR COMPILATION of PTAM (June 27, 2011, ga69qel)

- check out a newer version of libgvc than specified in the readme (2010 instead of 2009)
- add some missing imports in the source/header files (as specified by the error messages) -- mostly <stdio.h>
- in PTAM makefile, change MY_CUSTOM_LINK_PATH to /usr/local/lib
- Type: sudo su and enter: echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/loc_lib.conf
- /sbin/ldconfig
--> This ensures that the libraries in /usr/local/lib are found
- In the makefile, specifiy VideoSource_Linux_V4L for the Logitech Quickcam

Now all packages including PTAM itself compile.

Calibrate camera with ./CameraCalibration
Start recognition with ./PTAM

NOTES FOR COMPILATION of PTAMM (June 27, 2011, ga69qel)
- in PTAM makefile, change MY_CUSTOM_LINK_PATH to /usr/local/lib and specify VideoSource_Linux_V4L for the Logitech Quickcam
- do everything as stated in the manual


NOTES FOR IMPORTING THE PROJECT TO ECLIPSE
- File->Import
- Existing Code as Makefile Project
- Select Linux GCC

How wide is wide-angle? Readme says, the first parameter in camera.cfg is the normalized focal length and fx=0.57 for their system.
Up to fx<=1.0 it should work, above its bad.
For us, its mostly around 0.7-0.8

HOWTO: LOAD PRERECORDED VIDEO USING GSTREAMER
- download the VideoSource_Linux_Gstreamer_File.cc from http://ewokrampage.wordpress.com/video-sources/
- in the makefile, change the videosource to that file, and add `pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0` `pkg-config --cflags gstreamer-app-0.10` to compileflags, and
`pkg-config --libs glib-2.0` `pkg-config --libs gstreamer-app-0.10` to linksflags
- download all missing packages in order to successfully compile. For me, it was "libgstreamer-0.10-dev", "libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev"
- in VideoSource.h, add the declaration of  ~VideoSource();
